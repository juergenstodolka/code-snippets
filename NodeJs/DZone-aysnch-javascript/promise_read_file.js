/*
 A new Promise is in the pending state.
 If a Promise succeeds it is put in a resolved state otherwise it is rejected.
 Instead of using the original callback mechanism, code using Promises creates a Promise object.
 We use Promises typically with two callback handlers â€“ resolved invoked when
 the operation was successful and rejected called whenever an error has occurred.
